Why should I start writing a blog now? I've made it this far without the
need for one, and I don't really enjoy Facebook or Twitter or social
media in general. It comes down to wanting to better document for myself
things I'm interested in and ideas that I have.

That, and workflow.

Writing to a Wordpress site or anything through an online portal doesn't
fit my workflow. This is where Vim can make things awesome.

A few months ago I decided to move from Emacs as my work-a-day editor
and try to become more proficient with Vim. I've always known how to get
around in Vim, but never made use of some of its more powerful features.

The vim-go plugin changed this, and opened my eyes to some of the power
features that Vim offers. So I started reading up on all things Vim.

A few of the highlights:

-   vimgrep + :copen is awesome for quickly getting around in a codebase
-   programmability is better than that of emacs
-   TODO add more

And then I stumbled across Vimwiki. This initially would fill the gap
for what I used org-mode in Emacs for, but then I came across a few
articles that made me realize I could stay in my terminal-based editor
and publish to a blog:

-   <https://jamesbvaughan.com/markdown-pandoc-notes/>
-   Diary-mode in Vimwiki, plus automatic hooks to commit and push to a
    git repo on save.
-   Gatsbyjs and Netlify to automatically build and publish a website.
-   TODO more

Cool! So I can stay in my existing dev environment, and whenever I have
an idea, I can create a new Diary entry and publish it to a blog? I'll
give it a shot.
