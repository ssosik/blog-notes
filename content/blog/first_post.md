## Initial idea -

-   Use VimWiki Diary mode to write blog posts
-   Vim customization to commit and push changes up to origin on file
    save
    -   Build gatsby.js in a docker container
-   Use gatsby.js to pull the Markdown formatted content from github
-   Gatsby builds the content and pushes it to Netlify
-   If all that works, front-end Netlify with Cloudfront or Fastly
    (probably overkill)

## Content ideas -
